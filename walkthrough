Setup at start:
1. Move code from the /chromium directory in this repo to the correct location in the chromium source code
    README file in /chromium will help you with this

2. Build chromium source code to the out/Debug folder
    Look at the following sites for help
    https://www.chromium.org/quic/playing-with-quic
    https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/linux/build_instructions.md 

3. Modify start_client.sh and start_server.sh with install location (if needed)

4. Install the ISC DHCP server
    sudo apt install isc-dhcp-server

5. Copy dhcpd.conf file from this directory to /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf

6. Optional - Install the ISC DHCP client

To run the setup, start the mininet emulation with the custom topology
Assuming you're in the mimiq directory, run

sudo mn --custom ./mininet/DHCP_Topo.py --topo mytopo

Within the mininet CLI, run the following commands, in order:

# Start the DHCP server 
# If there is already a DHCP server running, this script will prompt you to kill it and restart the server
# This makes it easier to restart the DHCP server if you've changed the config logs
dhcp sh start_dhcpd.sh

# Start the QUIC server on the server
serv sh start_server.sh

# Start the QUIC client on the host
host sh start_client.sh

# (Optional) Start the QUIC client on other hosts
host2 sh start_client.sh
host3 sh start_client.sh
host4 sh start_client.sh
host5 sh start_client.sh
